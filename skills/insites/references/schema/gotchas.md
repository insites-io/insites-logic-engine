# Schema Gotchas

Common errors, limits, and troubleshooting for schema files.

## Common Errors

### "Table not found" or "Unknown table" in GraphQL

**Cause:** The schema file has not been deployed, or the `table` value in your GraphQL filter does not match the schema `name`.

**Solution:** Verify the `name` field in your YAML matches exactly what you use in `filter: { table: { value: "..." } }`. Run `insites-cli deploy dev` to push schema changes. Names are case-sensitive.

### "Name must match filename"

**Cause:** The `name` field inside the YAML file does not match the filename. For example, `app/schema/product.yml` contains `name: products` (plural mismatch).

**Solution:** Ensure the `name` field exactly matches the filename without extension. `product.yml` must have `name: product`.

### "Property not found" or null values in query results

**Cause:** The property name in your GraphQL accessor does not match the property name in the schema, or you are using the wrong accessor type.

**Solution:** Check spelling and case. Use the correct accessor -- `property_int()` for integers, `property_float()` for floats, `property_boolean()` for booleans. Using `property()` for a boolean field returns the string `"true"` or `"false"`, not an actual boolean.

### Upload returns null URL

**Cause:** The file was not uploaded correctly, or the property was set with a string value instead of an actual file upload through a form.

**Solution:** Uploads must come through multipart form submissions using the `file` input type. You cannot set upload properties via GraphQL string values. Ensure your form has `enctype="multipart/form-data"`.

### "Array values must be JSON"

**Cause:** Setting an `array` property with a plain string instead of a JSON array string.

**Solution:** Pass array values as JSON strings: `{ name: "tags", value: "[\"tag1\", \"tag2\"]" }`. In Liquid, use `| json` filter to serialize arrays.

### Removing a property from schema does not delete data

**Cause:** Schema deploys are additive. Removing a property from the YAML file does not drop the column or delete existing data.

**Solution:** This is by design. Old data remains accessible. If you need to clean up data, use a migration to null out or delete records. You can re-add the property later and existing data will still be there.

### Boolean filter not working

**Cause:** Filtering with `properties: [{ name: "active", value: true }]` -- passing a boolean literal instead of a string.

**Solution:** All property filter values must be strings: `{ name: "active", value: "true" }`.

## Limits

| Resource | Limit | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Properties per schema | ~200 | Practical limit; no hard cap documented |
| Property name length | 255 chars | Must be valid identifier |
| String property value | ~255 chars | Use `text` for longer content |
| Text property value | ~16 MB | Platform-dependent |
| Upload max file size | Configurable | Set via `max_size` in options |
| Schema files per app | No hard limit | Limited by deploy time |
| Array property values | JSON array | Must be valid JSON string |
| Nested objects | Not supported | Use `text` with JSON or separate tables |

```
Schema issue?
├── Deploy error?
│   ├── "Name must match filename"
│   │   └── Fix: Align name field with filename
│   └── YAML syntax error
│       └── Fix: Validate YAML (check indentation, colons, dashes)
│
├── Data not appearing?
│   ├── Is the table name correct in your GraphQL filter?
│   │   └── Fix: Must match schema name exactly (case-sensitive)
│   ├── Was the schema deployed?
│   │   └── Fix: Run insites-cli deploy dev
│   └── Are you using the right property accessor?
│       └── Fix: Match accessor to type (property_int for integer, etc.)
│
├── Upload not working?
│   ├── Is the form multipart?
│   │   └── Fix: Add enctype="multipart/form-data"
│   ├── Is the file within size/type limits?
│   │   └── Fix: Check max_size and content_type in schema options
│   └── Is acl set correctly?
│       └── public = CDN URL, private = signed URL; no acl option means public
│
└── Relationship not resolving?
    ├── Is the _id property storing the correct ID?
    │   └── Fix: Verify the stored value matches the target record ID
    └── Are related_record arguments correct?
        └── Fix: Check table, join_on_property, foreign_property

## `updated_at` is a stamp, not a change log

Measured on v5 and v6 instances between 28 September and 6 October 2026 (TW#26848289):

- An import that **clears** a property does not move `updated_at`; one that changes a value does. A `record_update` can leave it where it was.
- Two edits inside the same second carry the same `updated_at`.
- A row is only listed while it exists: a table whose rows were all deleted drops out of a `records` listing entirely, so a count of rows with `updated_at` after a point in time cannot show deletions.

So `filter: { updated_at: { gt: $since } }` is a guard, not a proof of "nothing changed". Anything that must know for certain (a final sync before a cutover, an audit) compares content, or freezes the source first.

## A deleted row keeps its id reserved

`record_delete` and `records_delete_all` set `deleted_at` and keep the row under its id (see `api.md`). The consequence for anyone re-importing: **that id cannot be imported again**. A row deleted and then imported under the same id comes back under a **new** id, with the old one in `external_id` when `_id_remap` is used (measured 28 September 2026: faqs row 4965, deleted and re-imported, returned as 17714 with `external_id` 4965).

## An Upload Property Can Hold an Upload, an Address or Nothing

Three states, three different reads (TW#26855355, measured on the v6 Ecommerce module's `product_image`, 5 October 2026):

| The property holds | `property(name:)` returns | `property_upload(name:) { url }` |
|---|---|---|
| a file uploaded through the platform | the upload's hash | the CDN `url` |
| an address a module's admin stored as text | that address, as a String | fails: `Property upload should contain only hash ... given of class String` |
| nothing | the text `{}` | null |

Writing the empty `{}` into another upload property is refused (`tried to store {} in property upload which is not a valid URL`). Read with `property(name:)` first and branch on the shape before copying one upload property into another.
