# Routing Troubleshooting Guide

Common routing errors, their causes, and solutions.

## Common Errors

### Route Not Matching

**Symptoms:** URL returns 404 or matches wrong page

**Cause:** File not in correct directory or filename doesn't match URL structure

**Solution:**

```
Expected URL: /products/123
Should be: app/views/pages/products/:id.liquid ✓
NOT: app/views/pages/product/:id.liquid ✗
```

> **Module note:** Module pages in `modules/<module_name>/public/views/pages/` are also mapped to routes. If a route isn't matching, check both `app/views/pages/` and any installed module's `public/views/pages/`.

Verify directory structure matches URL hierarchy:

```
URL /users/alice/posts should use:
app/views/pages/users/:username/posts.liquid
```

### Duplicate Slug Conflicts

**Symptoms:** Multiple pages match same URL, unpredictable behavior

**Cause:** Multiple files with same slug in different directories or extensions

**Solutions:**

1. Ensure unique filenames per directory:

```
WRONG:
app/views/pages/posts.liquid
app/views/pages/posts.json.liquid (different extension OK)

WRONG:
app/views/pages/posts/new.liquid
app/views/pages/posts/new.html.liquid (different extension OK)
```

2. Use different directories for different resource types:

```
CORRECT:
app/views/pages/articles/index.liquid (plural for lists)
app/views/pages/articles/:id.liquid (for individual items)
```

### HTTP Method Conflicts

**Symptoms:** POST/PUT/DELETE requests return 405 Method Not Allowed

**Cause:** Missing or wrong method in front matter

**Solution:** Specify method explicitly:

```yaml
---
method: post
---
```

One method per file. Separate files for different methods:

```
app/views/pages/users.liquid (method: get - list)
app/views/pages/users/create.liquid (method: post - create)
app/views/pages/users/:id/update.liquid (method: put - update)
app/views/pages/users/:id/delete.liquid (method: delete - delete)
```

### Missing CSRF Token

**Symptoms:** POST/PUT/DELETE forms fail with 403 Forbidden

**Cause:** Form submission missing CSRF token

**Solution:** Include token in forms:

```liquid
<form method="post" action="/items">
  <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token"
         value="{{ context.authenticity_token }}">
  <!-- form fields -->
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Or use Insites form helpers if available.

### 404 Not Found on Valid Routes

**Symptoms:** Page exists but returns 404

**Causes:**

1. File has wrong extension or in wrong location
2. Route priority - more specific route matches first
3. Query parameters interfering with slug matching

**Solution:**

```
Check file location:
URL: /api/users/123
File: app/views/pages/api/users/:id.liquid ✓

Check order (most specific first):
/posts/latest.liquid → /posts/latest
/posts/:id.liquid → /posts/123 (NOT /posts/latest)
```

### A Static Slug Also Answers Deeper Paths

**Symptoms:** A record URL such as `/ecommerce/api/v1/products/<uuid>` works on one instance and returns 404 on another, while the list URL works on both.

**Cause:** By default, a page answers any path below its slug. Measured on two instances on September 26, 2026: a page with the slug `ecommerce/api/v1/products` and no path parameter answered `/ecommerce/api/v1/products/<uuid>`, and still answered `/ecommerce/api/v1/products/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10`, both with 200 from the same page. The control: an unknown sibling, `/ecommerce/api/v1/zz-no-such-route`, returned 404 on both instances.

Older module pages rely on this. One page serves both the list and the record by parsing the path itself:

```liquid
{%- liquid
  assign template = "/ecommerce/api/v1/products/{uuid}"
  assign params = context.location.pathname | extract_url_params: template
-%}
{%- if params.uuid -%}
  {%- include "modules/insites_ecommerce/controllers/_external/products/get_product", uuid: params.uuid -%}
{%- else -%}
  {%- include "modules/insites_ecommerce/controllers/_external/products/get_products", query_params: context.params -%}
{%- endif -%}
```

`extract_url_params` returns nothing when the path does not match the template exactly. Measured on the same page: `/ecommerce/api/v1/products/<uuid>/a` returned the full list, not the record and not an error.

Setting `slug_exact_match: true` in `app/config.yml` turns the default off. A page then answers only its own slug, and every page built like the one above stops serving its record URL. In April 2024 this stopped every Events record opening on one instance, and Insites engineering traced it to this flag. The `true` behavior has not been re-measured for this entry.

**Solution:** declare the parameter in the slug, with one page per shape. This works whichever way the flag is set.

```
views/pages/api/products/get.liquid           slug: .../products          list only
views/pages/api/products/details/get.liquid   slug: .../products/:uuid    reads context.params.uuid
```

The same applies to `put`, `patch`, `delete` and `post` pages that take an id from the path: put the id in the slug (`.../products/:id`). A static sibling such as `.../products/variants` still takes priority over `.../products/:uuid`, per Route Priority & Matching Rules in [Configuration](./configuration.md).

**`max_deep_level` is not a reliable cap.** The platform schema defines `max_deep_level` as the URL nesting a slug resolves (`PageInputType.max_deep_level`, default 3): slug `abc` with 2 "will resolve /abc, abc/1, abc/2, but will NOT resolve abc/2/something". The page measured above declares `max_deep_level: 4` in its source and still answered a path ten segments below its slug. Do not rely on it to stop a page answering deeper paths.

## Limits and Constraints

| Constraint | Limit | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Route depth | Unlimited | `/a/b/c/d/e/f/...` all supported |
| Parameter count | Unlimited | `/users/:uid/posts/:pid/comments/:cid/...` OK |
| URL length | 2048 characters | Some browsers limit URLs |
| Query string size | 8192 characters | Platform dependent |
| Parameter name length | 255 characters | Use descriptive but concise names |
| File name length | 255 characters | OS file system limit |
| Special characters | Limited | Avoid: `<>:"/\|?*` in filenames |

## Troubleshooting Flowchart

```
Is the page returning 404?
├─ No file at expected path?
│  └─ Create: app/views/pages/your/route.liquid
│
├─ File exists but wrong location?
│  └─ Move to correct directory matching URL
│
├─ Dynamic route parameter not working?
│  └─ Check param name: /users/:id uses context.params.id
│
└─ Method not allowed (405)?
   └─ Add front matter: method: post (or put/delete)

Is context.params.xyz undefined?
├─ Parameter in URL? /posts/:xyz
│  └─ Check param name matches
│
├─ Query string? ?xyz=value
│  └─ Passed correctly via GET
│
└─ Try: {{ context.params | inspect }}
   (Shows all available params)

Are you getting wrong page content?
├─ More specific route available?
│  └─ Create: /specific/route.liquid (before wildcard)
│
├─ Multiple files same route?
│  └─ Remove duplicates in different extensions
│
└─ Verify with: {{ context.location.pathname }}
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Wildcard routes are expensive** - Match last after specific routes
   ```
   Specific: /posts/:id.liquid (fast)
   Wildcard: /docs/*path.liquid (slower, matches anything)
   ```

2. **Deep nesting impacts lookup** - 5+ levels reasonable
   ```
   /a/b/c/d/e.liquid (fine)
   /a/b/c/d/e/f/g/h.liquid (slower)
   ```

3. **Many parameters increase overhead** - Validate early
   ```liquid
   {% unless context.params.id and context.params.name %}
     {% response_status 400 %}
   {% endunless %}
   ```

## Debugging Techniques

### Inspect All Available Parameters

```liquid
{{ context.params | inspect }}
<!-- Output: {"id"=>"123", "page"=>"2", "sort"=>"date"} -->
```

### Check Request Location

```liquid
Pathname: {{ context.location.pathname }}
Search: {{ context.location.search }}
Host: {{ context.location.host }}
```

### Verify HTTP Method

```liquid
{% if context.method == "post" %}
  Form was posted
{% else %}
  Regular page load
{% endif %}
```

### Trace Route Matching

```liquid
<!-- File: app/views/pages/posts/:id.liquid -->
Accessed: {{ context.location.pathname }}
ID param: {{ context.params.id }}
All params: {{ context.params | inspect }}
```
